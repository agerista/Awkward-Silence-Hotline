## The Project

With all of the options we have for communicating these days like texting, 
twittering, and snapchatting, just to name a few, it seems as though we can't 
stop communicating with other people. With all of that communication, don't you 
deserve a pause every now and then? Wouldn't be great if that pause went on just 
a little too long? We think you do, so we decided created Awkward Silence Hotline. 
Awkward Silence Hotline uses Twilio to allow  a user to call a number, pick from 
a list of customized options, and basque in the gloriousness of the artisianal 
awkward silence that follows.

## The Tech Stack

This project is built using Python, Flask, and JavaScript. We used the Twilio API
for calls and texts.
